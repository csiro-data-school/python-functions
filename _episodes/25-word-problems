We now understand the syntax of Python functions and know how to put together very simple functions. However, how do you write a function when it is a bit more complex? How do you:

* know how 'big' to make your function, i.e. how many tasks should it do
* handle all possible inputs
* make sure others (and your future self!) know how to use your function


## Tinker till it works, or ...
Beginner (and often even advanced!) coders often start writing a new function by working out the logic inside
the black box. This path is hard and bug-prone! An alternative approach involves very precisely defining and describing what we want
our function to do first. Once that is crystal clear, working out the nuts and bolts inside the black box is much
easier.

## The black-box function

A well written function is a bit like a black box:

* you give it some input 
* it does some magic
* it spits out some output. 

Instead of tinkering with the insides first, we can do a really good job of designing what the outside of the box looks like 
first. Only once that is done, do we start work on the 'mechanics' inside the body of the function. 

## Design Recipe

This design recipe can be applied to functions in any language:

> ## DESIGN RECIPE
> 1. **Signature**: this decribes how many inputs and outputs our function has, and their type.
> 2. **Purpose**: a short, succinct description of the task (one line max)
> 3. **Stub**: puts names to the inputs and outputs of the function
> 4. **Examples**: demonstrates how you expect your function to behave in difference scenarios.
>
> We will go through each of these steps in turn below.

## Design recipe in Python

Say we want to write a function that converts temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius. Our design recipe looks like this:

~~~
# fahr_to_cel: Float -> Float
def fahr_to_celsius(temp_fahr):
    '''Converts temperature in fahrenheit to temperature in celsius
    >>> fahr_to_celsius(52.0)
    11.1
    >>> fahr_to_celsius(0)
    -17.8
    '''
    
    # magic...
    
    return(temp_cels)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's talk through this example step by step.

## Signature
  
The signature formalises the process of describing our function's inputs and outputs. In our example, it is the line:

~~~
# fahr_to_cel: Float -> Float
~~~
{: .language-python}

We start by giving our function a name, `fahr_to_cel`. Next, we describe the number and 'type' of inputs and outputs.
Here, we say `Float -> Float`, meaning we have one input of type `Float`, (before the `->`), and one output of type `Float`
(after the `->`). We start the signature line with a `#`, to turn it into a comment. Python itself doesn't care if this line is there or not, it is just a comment to help us understand the code and get our thoughts in order.

## Purpose

This one sounds deceptively easy: in one sentence (say, 80 characters max), describe what your function does.

> Purpose statement guidelines:
> * Don't repeat info that is in the signature. There is no need for the name of the function, or a description
> of its inputs and outputs.
> * Keep it as generic as possible. If it calculates the area of a rectangle, say it calculates the area of a rectangle. Don't say, it gives the area of a Boorowa field plot. 
> * Try and word it so any colleague in CSIRO would understand it.
> * If you absolutely need more than 80 characters, you probably need to further limit what the 'job' your function does is. You might be better off writing two smaller functions, rather than one larger one.

## Words to functions

Often, the hardest part of writing your own functions, is working out *what* you actually want your function to *do*. 
You're given a description of a task someone wants completed, and you need to turn this into language that the 
computer understands. Let's try some word problems. A colleague sends you an email asking:

"The field data is back from the trial, but unfortunately I'm having a lot of trouble loading it into the software because 
the assistant recorded the dates using the month's name, and the software demands dates formatted like 2018-03-02, 
2018-06-04, etc. Do you think you could write me a quick script to help me out?" 

Start by identifying the data in the description (it can help to use a highlighter to start with!). Here, the output data is a string, formatted as: `yyyy-mm-dd`. As 
input data, we have the names of months, also a string. Presumably, based on the output, we are given year and day as well.

> ## Data discussion
> Is this data description complete?
> Are we given enough information to write the program?
{: .discussion} 

After you've worked out the data, work out what the actual task you are being asked to do is. Here, you might say 
"Reformat dates containing month names to ODBC canonical date format e.g. yyyy-mm-dd."


> ## Antibiotics
> 
> Identify the input data, output data, and task in this word problem:
>
> Antibiotics are sometimes tested by placing antibiotic-impregnated paper disks onto bacteria-covered agar in a petri dish.
> Bacterial death spreads out from the antibiotic creating a perfect circular bacteria-free zone. You've recorded the 
> diameter of several hundreds of test plates, with three replicates per plate. You want to find 
> the average area of the bacterial zones for your resistance calculations.
{: .challenge}

> ## DNA
>
> Identify the input data, output data, and task in this word problem: 
>
> The component acids that form DNA are often represented as 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C', e.g. 'AATCGCGTTA'. The amount 
> of 'G' and 'C' in 
> a DNA sequence tends to be organism specific. You've received some sequence data from a service provider,
> and as a simple test of contamination you want to check its GC ratio.
{: .challenge}

> ## Design Recipe
> As you can see from the exercises above, there are often ambiguities involved in interpreting a problem. 
> Choices need to be made, often regarding:
> * the kind of input data your function will accept, and output data it will generate
> * the function's purpose; will it do everything in the description, or a smaller implied task?
>
> There is often not a 'right' or 'wrong' answer to these questions. However, you need answers in order to 
> define whether your function is working correctly, and in fact to know what you want to code in the first 
> place.
> This is where a 'Design Recipe' can help, by forcing you to answer these questions before you write code.
